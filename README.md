# Demo Client
## Client microservice description
Goals
  - The user could manage their client-related info.
  - The supporting information or field just enough for SME to get started (don't overwhelm the user and shouldn't be too complicated for implementation)
  - Could be connected to third-parties CRM to sync client and contact information.

Background and strategic fit: This service could consider an out of the box simple CRM (Customer Related Management) for our solution without touching the sale related aspect of a CRM. It could be a first step for us to support integration with any third party CRM like Hubspot, Pipedrive, or Salesforce.
